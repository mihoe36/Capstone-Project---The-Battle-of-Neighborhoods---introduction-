    "Calgary Alberta in Canada is the largest city in the province which is home to 1.34 million people, and has been selected in the top 10 most livable city in the world from 2009 to 2019  by the Economist Intelligence Unit. A combination of wildlife landscape, urban sprawl and downtown commercialism made Calgary an attractive city for many international newcomers and Canadians seeking to relocate.\n",

This project will attempt to answer the questions “Where would be an affordable neighbourhood to buy a house?” and “What venues would be available in each neighbourhood ?'"
